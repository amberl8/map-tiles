# Map Design and Tile Generation
For this project, I created four map layers of Seattle and some of its surrounding areas. Each layer is available at the zoom levels 10 to 14. Click here(INSERT LINK) to access the web application.

### Layer 1: Modified Basemap
This layer started as the light monochrome basemap provided by Mapbox, but I then edited the the color palette as well as fonts of the basemap to create my own unique layer.

The second layer contains points representing the locations of all branches of the Seattle Public Libraries.

### Layer 4: LGBTQ Theme
This layer started as the dark monochrome basemap provided by Mapbox, but I then edited the color palette to embody LGBTQ+ pride, particularly to match the bisexual flag.
